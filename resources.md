## Proposed rules
Each player has a set of colored balls and a spring powered cue. 
Both cues have a maximum tension, dictating how far a ball can be pushed in a single turn at maximum power.

The table is covered with posts that light up when hit, and two holes. (edit: I see only one hole in the drawing) 
From what I can gather, the object is to light up all your posts and then sink all your balls into the goal. 
One hit activates and deactivates the posts, 
so the opponent can deactivate your posts or a bad move can accidentally set you back.

Strategy comes in the form of knowing when to go for the goal. 
If a player sinks all his balls but one and then the opponent deactivates a post, he's at a disadvantage.
