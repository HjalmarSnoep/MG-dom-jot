## Proposed rules 1
Each player has a set of colored balls and a spring powered cue. 
Both cues have a maximum tension, dictating how far a ball can be pushed in a single turn at maximum power.

The table is covered with posts that light up when hit, and two holes. 
From what I can gather, the object is to light up all your posts and then sink all your balls into the goal. 
One hit activates and deactivates the posts, 
so the opponent can deactivate your posts or a bad move can accidentally set you back.

Strategy comes in the form of knowing when to go for the goal. 
If a player sinks all his balls but one and then the opponent deactivates a post, he's at a disadvantage.

## proposed rules 2
I see only one hole in the table. And 10 balls total, not all of which are doubled in color.
But I like the idea of two players, hitting each other´s pins.
How about this:
- the pins light up in the color of the balls. They have a base color of themselves (non-lit)
- your cue ball is the color of the last pin you lit up, or yellow.
-all balls start in the hexagonal area 12321, except yellow, which is the color for the first player. This ball starts behind the hooked line at the far end. This would allow for a kind of ´break´
- the object is to get nine points, the number of points you get is the number of poles lit in the correct color, when you sink the balls.
- you would typically play a uneven number of rounds to determine a winner, like best out of three. This would allow for heavy betting.
