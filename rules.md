## Proposed rules 1
Each player has a set of colored balls and a spring powered cue. 
Both cues have a maximum tension, dictating how far a ball can be pushed in a single turn at maximum power.

The table is covered with posts that light up when hit, and two holes. 
From what I can gather, the object is to light up all your posts and then sink all your balls into the goal. 
One hit activates and deactivates the posts, 
so the opponent can deactivate your posts or a bad move can accidentally set you back.

Strategy comes in the form of knowing when to go for the goal. 
If a player sinks all his balls but one and then the opponent deactivates a post, he's at a disadvantage.

## proposed rules 2
I see only one hole in the table. And 10 balls total, not all of which are doubled in color.
But I like the idea of two players, hitting each other´s pins.
How about this:
- the pins light up in the color of the balls. They have a base color of themselves (non-lit)
- your cue ball is the color of the last pin you lit up, or yellow.
-all balls start in the hexagonal area 12321, except yellow, which is the color for the first player. This ball starts behind the hooked line at the far end. This would allow for a kind of ´break´
- the object is to get nine points, the number of points you get is the number of poles lit in the correct color, when you sink any of the balls (even your cueball, since to score it would have to hit a pin first).
- you would typically play a uneven number of rounds to determine a winner, like best out of three. This would allow for heavy betting.
- hitting straight nines would mean you would hit 9 pins before sinking each ball, getting a large amount of points. (Theoretically a 10 is possible, but one pin is an outlier, so that makes it really hard if not impossible with the power of the cues being electronically regulated)

## proposed rules 3
Could be two sets of red, green and blue balls, there is a slight color difference that would allow players to keep track of their balls.
And a loose yellow purple orange and cyan ball. These could be the scoring balls, numbering 1,2,4 and 8 points.
The pins could change colors to red green and blue and allow you to bounce of them with one of your playing balls.
Sinking a scoring ball in the hole would give you the amount of points for this ball. Bouncing it of one of the pins in the color of your cue ball doubles the score. This way there is many ways to make 9´s 8+1, 4+4+1. Doubling the 1 would ruin your chances and also scoring the one would ruin your opponents chance of a 9.
You could use your cue ball to sink your opponents cueballs in an aggressive move.
If the opponent has no more cue balls or all scoring-balls are sunk, the game is done.
The one who has the most points then wins, a score of exactly 9 is doubled. So a 9 beats a 8+8=16.
This would make for some interesting strategics.
I don´t know if it would be practical to keep track of the slightly different colors in "real life" but it wouldn´t be a problem for a computer game.
We might put a little dot on one set.
Only problem with this is, we´d have to figure out how the balls start on the table and fit in the marked areas.. This is no problem with set 2.
